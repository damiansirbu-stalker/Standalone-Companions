Standalone Companions: Custom companions for STALKER Anomaly, by Damian
Latest: 1.0.1 (xlibs 1.0.5)

No quest requirements. Just talk and recruit. Each companion has their own personality, location, and recruitment method. Permadeath keeps it real - if they die, they stay dead.

Anna is Duty. Find her at Rostok Bar. Earn 2000+ Duty goodwill or join Duty, then talk to her. She joins as a standard companion with full Anomaly companion controls.

Mila is a mercenary. Find her at Dead City. Pay 100,000 rubles. Business is business.

Both companions auto-spawn at their default locations on game load. MCM gives full control: enable/disable each companion, toggle auto-spawn, teleport them to you or yourself to them. Debug options let you reset permadeath if needed.

Written against X-Ray Monolith engine source, Demonized exes source code, and Anomaly 1.5.3 unpacked gamedata.
Code patterns and engine usage validated against established work by reputable GAMMA modders (Demonized, Vintar0, RavenAscendant, xcvb).
The code is validated in real time by a multi-stage pipeline: luacheck, selene, tree-sitter AST analysis, contract rules, cross-file dependency resolution, cyclomatic complexity analysis, crash and vulnerability pattern detection, lua54 integration testing with X-Ray engine stubs, gitleaks secret scanning.
